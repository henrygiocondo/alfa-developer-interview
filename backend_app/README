## About
RESTful API built using Node + Express technologies.

## Requirements
Be sure you have **node** and **npm** installed, you can download easily in the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
After the installation you can open the terminal and test both node and npm typing
```
node -v
```
This way you'll get node's respective version if the installation was fully OK.
```
npm -v
```
This way you test the npm, the same way you test node.
If you have both messages you are ready to go! :)
The **npm** is used to install and manage project dependencies and run it by command line, **becomes with node instalation**.
## How to use
To run the application you must have installed NodeJS and npm, click [here](https://nodejs.org/) to go to the offical website and download.
With everything configured, you must open your personal terminal and go to the `src/server.js` folder.
Run `npm i` to intall all the dependecies. This process may take a while.
Run `npm start` to start the application and that's all.
To stop the running application press `ctrl + c` and `S` after.
